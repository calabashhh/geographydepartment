                <p>The history and trajectory of the study of Geography is fraught and full
                of anxieties. Though this history is not necessarily tied to what
                happened to the department at Harvard, it is still a quite useful place
                from which to focus our lens. When we read the history of the Geography
                Department at Harvard we see a few things at play (Smith, 1987). First
                there are the characters, representatives of their classes and
                circumstances acting in roles in which we are not entirely surprised by.
                Second, there are the textured themes of the institutional Academy at
                the middle of the twentieth century. Third, there is the particular
                intellectual history of the field of Geography up until this inflection
                point, and then what has transpired since then.</p>
                
                <p>The further in time from the viewer an event is will change the
                perspective and the understanding. Too close too it; and it is too
                massive to comprehend. Like sitting in the front row of a movie theater.
                While the immediacy of the event tends to produce more emotion, and
                visceral connection; generally one must be a certain distance away from
                it in time to gain a sense of what has transpired following the event.
                Looking back towards the inception of the study of Geography in the mid
                1870s from our vantage point in 2023, we look over a chasm of about 150
                years and find that the elimination of Geography at Harvard take places
                almost directly between these two points. A symmetry that maybe we can
                use to help us better understand things.</p>
                
                <p>Why did Geography generally emerge out of the study of Geology in the US
                University systems? If we can cast ourselves back to that time, we will
                understand that Industrial Capital is expanding its spread further
                across the Globe. In the United States following the US Civil War, where
                Northern Industrial Capital dominated the Southern Slave based
                Agricultural Capital, a newly empowered national Industrial Capital
                began to emerge. This churning machine needs resources and people and
                land to feed its ravenous hunger. The study of Geology at these
                educational institutions allows for this capital to better find and
                extract the mineral wealth it requires. It is employed as a tool for
                imperial industrial capital. This is the environment which Geography
                emerges out of Geography.</p>
                
                <p>While these both are tools for studying the earth and human's relation
                to it and the other people and things upon it, the Academy is a
                participant in this project. Producing the competent professional
                managerial class it requires to out compete the other voracious national
                amalgams of Capital and Power. Geographers have for long before the
                advent of the early modern capital driven world been involved in the
                work of imperial colonial projects. Long before our globe encircling
                satellite network, there was a time when people did not necessarily know
                the shape of continents or the origins of rivers. Geographers used their
                knowledge to map and understand the regions of the world, and were
                encouraged to do so by political power in order to capitalize upon this
                information about where advantage lay. Trade routes, the locations of
                desert oasis, and gold deposits all these were deeply guarded secrets.</p>
                
                <p>This knowledge of the landscape of the outside world has always been
                entangled with the expansion of political power. So it is no surprise to
                see it still being entangled with it as political power becomes infused
                with the emergent national amalgams of modern industrial capital in the
                late 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
                
                <p>This strain of geographic thought and practice as it came into its own
                in the Academy sought the legitimacy of other departments and fields. As
                legitimacy in this modern context was primarily seen as scientific and
                rational so to must Geography strive to achieve these goals in its own
                realm. Here we see environmental determinism, the mapping of racial
                characteristics, and other pseudo-science endeavors at the vanguard of
                geographical scholarship and thought. Geographers were doing the work of
                empire here. Mackinder (1904) for example while seeming to outline some
                truism about the centrality of Eurasia was instead merely making a
                justification for Britain's own massive empire and continued expansion.
                With the fiery conflagration which started in 1914 and ended with the
                Allied victory in 1945, this search for a unified approach to geographic
                thought fell out of favor. The pseudo-science was discredited and so
                with it went most of the field's search for a unifying theme. Even the
                notion of having a unified theme seemed suspect.</p>
                
                <p>This is the larger Academy background into which we find the
                cancellation of Harvard's Geography department following the concluding
                of the world wars. It is notable that in early the years of the 20<sup>th</sup>
                century the study of geography in the US became much more focused
                providing military assistance. This makes some sense as a continuation
                of the imperial project which it participated in in the late 19<sup>th</sup>
                century. With the closing of the frontier, the great national based
                amalgams of industrial capital no longer were contending for territory
                which was unspoken for, so to speak.</p>
                
                <p>It is interesting that Derwent Whittlesey had assumed that there would
                be a great out flowing of funds from the victorious US government
                towards Geography programs in the US, like Harvard's following the end
                of the two world wars and in the service of establishing a post-war Pax
                Americana. This piece of information seems to support the notion that so
                much of the push behind Geographical study in the US Academy was in the
                support of imperial projects. Why this did not materialize is still
                worth studying. Perhaps it is due to the nature of this new US Capital
                dominant hegemony. Perhaps it felt that the kind of expertise which
                geographers could provide was not useful or compatible with the type of
                domination it was producing. Or it could be that focus for the
                development of producing new imperial tools lay outside the usually
                dominant centers of established power in the North East of the US, and
                instead was being spent in the newly emergent West and Sunbelt areas.
                This direction and interruption of resources from the center seems to
                play a much larger role in the future and direction of Geography at
                Harvard than the proximate causes of homophobia and inter-departmental
                politics. While these certainly played major roles in the events of the
                discontinuation of the department, I do not believe that they are or
                were unique to Harvard or to this time period. They might offer an
                immediate explanation to understand this particular case, but they are
                not sufficient in and of themselves to explain the predicament of
                Geography as a whole.</p>
                
                <p>This piece takes a similar view of the circumstances surrounding the
                downfall of Geography departments at ANU (Lahiri-Dutt, 2018) and at the
                University of Michigan (Huntley & Rosenblum, 2020). While there might be
                proximate causes related to misogyny, racism, the loss of significant
                figures within the department, or political disagreements with the
                faculty; none of these are especially unique to Geography departments
                and none of them are able to explain the "existential anxieties" within
                Geography.</p>
                
                <p>Harvard's discontinuation of Geography is to be taken as a symbol, an
                inflection point in the history of the field of Geography, after which
                the flood gates of retrenchment seemed to open. As a field, it continues
                to struggle intellectually to define itself. With the emergence of a
                Geography separate from Geology, Geography found itself with two parts:
                one wedded to the physical, the geomorphic; and the other attempting to
                describe a human connection. This split identity was able to find
                intellectual purchase with the pursuit of "truth" through the
                exploration of the idea environmental determinism. With this idea being
                discredited, there was no unified idea to bring its parts together.
                Though theorists within the field have made attempts to bridge this gap
                it seems clear through the intervening years and through the cases at
                both U of M and ANU that the discipline still resides in this
                no-mans-land, wandering the wilderness in the aftermath.</p>
                
                <p>Geographers have even given this term a name and discuss it frequently,
                the "unity myth". This idea, which if Geographers are unable to agree
                upon one object of their study, then Geography must instead be the
                invisible bridge which connects all these disparate strains of hard and
                social sciences. However, it seems clear that this unity myth is mostly
                just that. This myth is a shibboleth for Geographers who are unable to
                agree upon what they all do together. Taking the example of U of M and
                in looking at their list of professors and their areas of study it is
                notable that though many will speak about Geography being a bridge, the
                faculty was pretty clearly divided between two halves and that there was
                no obvious crossover between cultural and physical.</p>
                
                <p>This intellectual drift has of course been exacerbated by the
                neo-liberal turn of the last quarter or so of the 20<sup>th</sup> century
                assaulting the Academia, which looks for ways to extract value and cut
                funding in the service of supposed "efficiency". This pressure has has
                bared down across the Academy and caused much consternation and
                tribulation. The competition for funding, for students; between
                institutions, departments, and faculty members has only worked to
                further degrade and demoralize. The largest and most egregious take away
                from the study of the naming changes of various Geography and Geography
                related departments in the US and Canada was how vapid it all is.
                Academics trying to ape the workings of marketers. For faculty to all
                but ask students to tell them what their department or class should be
                called only fits further into both this neo-liberal turn as well as the
                decades long drift for the field.</p>
                
                <p>If the field still is unable to come up with a convincing explanation
                for what the main object of their inquiry is which can encompass all
                that Geographers do, then it certainly seems unlikely that it can do so
                under these current trends which see the costs of higher education
                rising with no end in sight and thus ever greater pressures which will
                be brought to bear upon the field. I cannot see how this field can hold
                together without a unifying object of purpose. Of course the current
                trends within the Academy also seem unlikely that a unifying direction
                will come about. It does seem however that Geographers in the Academy
                are quite fearful of this loss of departmental status. Though it is
                unclear if this fear around this stems from the loss of power, prestige,
                and job security that are centered within a department or if it has
                anything to do with needing a department to give validity and
                intellectual gravity to their teaching and research.</p>
                
                <p>We certainly have seen how the arc of US geography departments have
                developed out of the contingency of circumstance and necessity rising
                out of Geology in the mid 19<sup>th</sup> century. The status of a department is
                cherished, but is it needed? Does it best serve the study of Geography?
                Clearly Geography is nothing if not an interdisciplinary subject and it
                is this interdisciplinarity which is both its strength and weakness.
                While some academics may dream of an interdisciplinary higher education
                with fewer or even no traditional departments, it generally remains only
                that, a dream. And under the current circumstances of economics and
                politics it is unlikely that it will be a strong trend reshaping higher
                ed anytime soon. It does seem to be however the best option and the one
                most suited to the nature of Geography. Geography is the study of space
                and place, it is an attempt to understand the relations between things
                within space and the perspective we have on those things and how
                positions within space affect those perspectives. Geography is concerned
                with things at a range of scales: there is a global geography, national
                geography, regional geography, local geography, a domestic geography,
                and even a microscopic geography. It is this nature which causes it to
                be so challenged by the current limited configuration of departments
                within a US Academic context.</p>
                
                <p>Perhaps this is to be expected. It is quite curious that Herodotus is
                both the father of Geography as well as History. He certainly did not
                set out to create two fields of study or inquiry, but I do not think it
                is an accident that these two fields have a united origin. Both are the
                study of quite elemental features of existence: space and time. Both of
                these elements are, as we have come to understand through contemporary
                physics, neither as simple or as separate from each other as was
                commonly thought. Of course, though we may understand through the
                theoretical lens of physics these truths, it is still something that we
                mere humans have difficulty understanding or experiencing in ways which
                are universally understood and expressed. It is the human-centered-ness
                of these phenomena which we cannot escape and yet it is this which we
                must use to understand ourselves and our world.</p>
                
                <p>While much hay has been made about Geography being a bridge between the
                hard and the social sciences. We also know that such distinctions are
                themselves arbitrary. But we do also know that it has continually come
                up short in this supposed role between the two. And yet maybe, it still
                could be that bridge, but perhaps the issue is less that it is too
                ambitious than it is not ambitious enough. Why cannot Geography, like
                History, embrace its humanity and seek to be a bridge between, not just
                the hard and social sciences but the humanities as well? This is not a
                likely path for the field, and certainly not a lucrative one, but it
                seems to offer more than can the cul-de-sac it finds itself in.</p>
